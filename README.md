# D3

Data-Driven Documents or D3 is a Javascript Library that enables the manipulation of HTML elements using Javascript.  D3 can be used to create new HTML elements, or append new features to existing elements; or to transform existing elements into charts, graphs, image galaries, or selections. Another feature of D# s its ability to pass data into Javascript and bind it to HTML elements through promise chain functions for JSON and CSV sources. The data is imported from these sources then passed to Javascript and bound to HTML elements to create Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs). 

## SVG

Scalable Vector Graphics are a type of data visualization in Javascript made possible by the D3 library. While Plotly allows a data analyst to pass data through a function and render pre-defined graphs with if provided with appropriate arguments; D3 can create an SVG element and pass data to it; it can also add new HTML elements within an SVG element using data as attributes, text, or features
